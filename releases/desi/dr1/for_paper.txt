This VAC consists of a galaxy group catalog constructed from the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey Y1 main sample. The catalog is built using halo-based group finding methods; specifically the Self-Calibrated Group Finder (Tinker 2022). The catalog identifies central and satellite galaxies and provides assumed dark matter halo masses, a by-product of the group finding algorithm. Included in this catalog are regions of the DESI Y1 footprint where 3 passes were made. This corresponds to an area of 2680 deg^2, containing 2,027,426 galaxies. We find 199,294 groups with at least 1 satellite. Targets in this footprint that were not observed spectroscopically (20.0%) are assigned redshifts either from an on-sky neighbor or photometric redshift estimates, and are included in the catalog with a column to indicate the source of the redshift.

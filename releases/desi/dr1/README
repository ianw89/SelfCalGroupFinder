This folder contains galaxy group catalogs built from DESI BGS Year 1 data. These are INTERNAL group catalog drafts. You are welcome to use them for whatever purpose, but please contact Ian Williams (ianwilliams@nyu.edu) and/or Jeremy Tinker (jlt12@nyu.edu) if you plan on publishing anything that uses these data, especially before public versions of these catalogs are available (likely with DR1).

These catalogs are built using a public halo-based group finder. The code used is in https://github.com/ianw89/SelfCalGroupFinder. For details, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12200, https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02946 and a forthcoming paper directly describing this catalog's construction.

These files are csv. Where appropriate there are little h factors as H=100 cosmology is used. The columns are:

target_id - DESI target id, for matching with other DESI data products, same as LSS Catalogs
RA - right ascension, same as LSS Catalogs
Dec - declination, same as LSS Catalogs
z - redshift (either observed or assigned if unavailable)
L_gal - luminosity in [solar luminosities / h^2] as converted from r-band absolute Mag
V_max - max volume this galaxy could be seen in based on L_gal; for 1/Vmax corrections
P_sat - a number between 0 and 1 indicating how likely this galaxy is to be a satellite as per the group finding algorithm. See Tinker papers for details. It is not a true probability. When greater than 0.5 the galaxy is considered a satellite.
M_halo - assigned halo mass (of entire group) in [solar masses / h]
N_sat - number of satellites in the group which this galaxy is part of.
L_tot - total observed group luminositiy in [solar luminosities / h^2]
igrp - unique group identifier. All members of a group share this number.
weight - internal detail of group finding. How central luminosity was weighted; see Tinker 2020.
app_mag - r-band apparent magnitude from the Legacy survey.
z_assigned_flag - an enumerated value to specify where the redshift is from. 0=DESI spectra. -1=SDSS spectra. -2=random redshift. -3=photometric redshift. n>0 means the redshift was taken from the nth nearest on-sky neighbor, using all observed galaxies in BGS BRIGHT+FAINT as the catalog to draw from. 
g_r - g-r color from the Legacy survey fluxes, k corrected to z=0.1
is_sat - True if this is a satellite of some other galaxy
quiescent - True if we consider this a quiescent galaxy 
mstar - stellar mass estimated from fastspecfit [solar masses]
